I sometimes get questions by email or occasionally via dicus on my blog. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

### Who am I?

I'm a hired gun / freelance software developer specialising in pragmatic funtional languages like F# and Elm etc but I also like languages in general such as Pony, Rust, Swift, and Kotlin.  Very occasional speaker, sometimes hermit.  

Over the years I've done a lot of work on F# OSS projects like the F# addin for monodevelop/Xamarin Studio/VS4 Mac, created the FSharp.Compiler.Service to help tooling services in the early days when it was even more fragmented. 

You can reach me on Twitter: [@7sharp9_exhumed](https://twitter.com/7sharp9_exhumed), or my [blog](http://7sharpnine.com) when I remember to renew my domain.
