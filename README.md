I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

### Who am I?

I'm a freelance software developer, hired gun etc, contributor to OSS projects, occasional speaker, sometimes hermit. 

You can reach me on Twitter: [@7sharp9_exhumed](https://twitter.com/7sharp9_exhumed), or my [blog](http://7sharpnine.com) when I remember to renew my domain.
